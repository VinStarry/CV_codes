# Computer Vision Codes

This is a repository containing codes concerning computer vision.

## Elementary

The directories in `Elementary` contains codes that use [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)'s data as training data and test data to do classification.

I use OpenCV4(C++) as a basic tool to deal with classification problems. The codes are easy to read.

Currently, the [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/VinStarry/CV_codes/tree/master/elementary/knn) method has been finished.

This repository will be continuously updated.
