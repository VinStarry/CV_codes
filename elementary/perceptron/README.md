# Perceptron
The perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. It has some limitations but is still worthy to be implemented. This project will dynamically show how the perceptron works in a two-dimensional space.

The 2D-data (points) processed must be linear separable for perceptron. So in this project, we manually generated points (which are linear separable) as input. We use C++ to find the plane which divids these points into two parts, and we record every step of this process. Finally we use Python to visualize them.
